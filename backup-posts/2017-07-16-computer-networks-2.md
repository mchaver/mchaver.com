User Datagram Protocol provides a reliable, ordered and error-checked 
delivery of a stream of octets between applications running on host that 
communicate via an IP network.

 Applications that do not require reliable data stream service may use the 
 User Datagram Protocol (UDP), which provides a connectionless datagram service 
 that emphasizes reduced latency over reliability.
